		<description>Finally managed to check out this podcast I had downloaded a few months ago. It was a really interesting discussion, although the audio was all over the place...

Might I suggest you guys to work with @acmhatre from TheIndicast.com. He used to do a Tech show, but stopped recently. Maybe you can work with him help each other out.. Just a suggestion so that this conversation can keep going.. Njoy!</description>
