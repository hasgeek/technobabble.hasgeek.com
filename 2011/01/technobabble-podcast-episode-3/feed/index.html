		<description>Thanks, Ashwin. For the next episode, I will be calling in from Ahmedabad, a day ahead of the Ahmedabad edition of our event. That event already has us on our toes.</description>

		<description>Excellent podcast guys! I was actually a bit sad to see it end earlier
than usual.

I like the direction the TechnoBabble podcast is taking. Kiran&#039;s conference war
stories were very thrilling to listen to! I would love to keep hearing
more from the PoV of India, Asia, enterprise or your own personal war
stories. Not that I do not like hearing about the latest smartphone or
Web x.0 babble, but every other podcast out there covers that, if you
get my drift :-)</description>
