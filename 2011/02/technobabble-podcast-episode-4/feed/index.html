		<description>It was again entertaining to listen to Kiran&#039;s stories from Ahmedabad! I loved Hitesh&#039;s 3 main criteria for the work-life quality of an Indian city: electricity, internet and traffic. Reminded me of Indira Gandhi&#039;s roti, kapda and makaan. :-)

The Google-Bing fight reminds me of how stoic research in fields like AI, computer vision were about taking in any human interaction. For decades, they wanted a pure machine solution to their problems. But now, almost all of their practical solutions have benefited by adding some (direct or indirect) human feedback into the loop. It is not hard to see that search algorithms will also end up requiring some human feedback, thus making this latest allegation by Google a bit trifling.</description>
