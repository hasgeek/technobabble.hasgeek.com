		<description>Also anshul, I guess it will feel long to people who aren&#039;t interested that much. My dad listens to podcasts on his desk (sometimes) as he is interested. I guess</description>

		<description>On show length, I think 45 minutes is a good target to shoot for if we have 3 main segments to the show. 

Audio Production remains a sore point for me. Now that the podcast hosts are improving their setups, I think the sound quality is starting to improve. A lot of it though will depend on how prep-work we do before we start the show, and we really need to work on that.

I&#039;m not aware of any way to &quot;tag&quot; mp3 files - Apple allows AAC files to be bookmarked, but this works only in iOS devices. In addition, short of using youtube to host the mp3 files - there may be no way to have a URL that also includes a time-stamp.

I think guests are a great idea, although we might want to do guests every alternate show - that allows for regular topical discussions as well.</description>

		<description>Guests are a good idea. The length, I guess, needs to be tuned to the average commute ride, accompanied with a marketing push suggesting folks listen to it on their commute.</description>

		<description>IMO 1 hour is needed for such a podcast. It is not long if one listens to it on commute or while driving. It feels ridiculously long if one tries to listen to it at their desk :-)

Can we have guests to come on the show? Like folks involved in Indian startups, localization or open source software in India. A guest plus chit-chat on the latest tech news, war stories and gadgets could be good refreshing content.</description>
