		<description>Finally managed to check out this podcast I had downloaded a few months ago. It was a really interesting discussion, although the audio was all over the place...

Might I suggest you guys to work with @acmhatre from TheIndicast.com. He used to do a Tech show, but stopped recently. Maybe you can work with him help each other out.. Just a suggestion so that this conversation can keep going.. Njoy!</description>

		<description>Also anshul, I guess it will feel long to people who aren&#039;t interested that much. My dad listens to podcasts on his desk (sometimes) as he is interested. I guess</description>

		<description>On show length, I think 45 minutes is a good target to shoot for if we have 3 main segments to the show. 

Audio Production remains a sore point for me. Now that the podcast hosts are improving their setups, I think the sound quality is starting to improve. A lot of it though will depend on how prep-work we do before we start the show, and we really need to work on that.

I&#039;m not aware of any way to &quot;tag&quot; mp3 files - Apple allows AAC files to be bookmarked, but this works only in iOS devices. In addition, short of using youtube to host the mp3 files - there may be no way to have a URL that also includes a time-stamp.

I think guests are a great idea, although we might want to do guests every alternate show - that allows for regular topical discussions as well.</description>

		<description>Bala - apologies. The irregularities with the file names are due to production duties on the podcast shifting between different folks. Now that I&#039;m back in Singapore, I hope to be able to resume regular production duties and keep everything nice &amp; consistent.</description>

		<description>Bala, good point. We&#039;re hosting files on Dropbox for now, so the name changes depending on who is posting. We need to fix a hosting location, maybe S3.</description>

		<description>Small request: Can you please name the files consistently? Much easier to save the files and keep track of what I have listened to and what I have not.</description>

		<description>Guests are a good idea. The length, I guess, needs to be tuned to the average commute ride, accompanied with a marketing push suggesting folks listen to it on their commute.</description>
