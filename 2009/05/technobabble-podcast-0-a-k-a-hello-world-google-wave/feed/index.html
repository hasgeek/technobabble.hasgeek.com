		<description>Good stuff guys!!! Just a question, how many of you are currently working in a Company. The number of Reply-All emails justifies having a solution similar to Wave.</description>

		<description>I liked the freewheeling discussion. Anyway, here is my suggestion - Since:1. you guys plan to do this monthly; &amp; 2. the podcast is an hour long. Is it possible to squeeze in a few more topics into the discussion? Something like 20 minute discussions on 3 noteworthy software/ideas etc. for that month, rather than just 1 topic would be more enjoyable, I think. Anyway, congrats on your maiden podcast. I look forward to more from you guys :-)</description>
